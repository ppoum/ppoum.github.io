                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>My goal with this project was to get more familiar with GUI libraries. I chose Java as a language
                    because it had been a while since I had used it for a personal project, and I had never created a
                    graphical application in Java. I wanted to create an application that didn't look "vanilla",
                    something that I could potentially see being shipped out by a real company. In the end, I'm not
                    quite sure the physical aspect of the GUI looks quite as good as I wanted it to; the application
                    looks somewhat empty, and I'm still using the default button style (although it would be fairly easy
                    to update the project to have more recent looking buttons). Nonetheless, I am still very happy with
                    how the application turned out, as I think the sudoku grid looks quite good, and the pencil markings
                    offer additional information without overloading the user with information.</p>
                <p>Finally, the project uses gradle to standardize the building and packaging of the project, but this
                    solution is somewhat overkill, as there are no dependencies (Swing is already bundled with recent
                    java version).</p>

            <section class="cell" id="init" data-magellan-target="init">
                <h2>Initialization</h2>

                <p>This stage represents the application launching. During development, I often found myself re-entering
                    the same grid over and over. To streamline my development process, I implemented a feature that I
                    think would be beneficial to users as well. When opening the application, the user has the option of
                    providing a base64-encoded version of a sudoku grid, which automatically gets loaded into the grid.
                    If no string is provided, the grid starts out empty.</p>

            <section class="cell" id="setup" data-magellan-target="setup">
                <h2>Setup</h2>

                <p>The setup stage is used to set up the sudoku grid. If a grid was loaded using a b64 string, the
                    grid will be preloaded with the specified values. Users can then add or remove cells in the grid. To
                    help, pencil markings are automatically updated while entering new cell values. Additionally, the
                    application will block the user's inputs if they are trying to add an illegal value in a cell.</p>

                <h2>Solving</h2>

                <p>Currently, I have only implemented one algorithm because it fulfilled my needs. The code already uses
                    interfaces, so implementing new solving algorithms would be plug-and-play with the rest of the
                    code.</p>
                <p>The currently implemented algorithm is an organic algorithm mimicking the way I personally solve
                    sudokus, namely by looking at missing numbers in a row, column or square. If there is only one
                    number that would be compatible with a cell, or if a missing number can only go into 1 cell for a
                    row, column or square, the algorithm sets the value of this cell. We can iteratively call the
                    algorithm until the whole board has been solved, or until the algorithm gets stuck.</p>

                    it alerts the user.</p>
